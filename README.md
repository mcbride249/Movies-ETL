# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

Extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database that will allow Amazing Prime to conduct a hackathon to develop an algorithm that will predict which low budget movies will become popular.

**Goals:**

1. Extract the Wikipedia Movies JSON and the Kaggle Data.
2. Clean the Wikpedia, Kaggle and Ratings data and merge the metadata.
3. Create a database and load the data into it.
     

**##Summary**

1. Extract the Wikipedia Movies JSON and the Kaggle Data.

2. Clean the Wikpedia, Kaggle and Ratings data and merge the metadata.

3. Create a database and load the data into it.






**##Resources**
-Data Source: movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json
-Software: Python 3.7.10, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1, pgAdmin 4v6


**##Module 8 - Challenge** 

**##Purpose##**

The purpose of this challenge was to extract and transform real world movie data sets from Wikipedia and Kaggle and then merge them before loading them into a database. The method for this required one to improt the Wikipedia data using its JSON file and importing the data from Kaggle using the movies_metadata.csv and ratings.csv files provided on its website. The data provided in these documents would be "cleaned" by filtering and refining the data to only relevant the relevant information that we decided should be included in our own hackathon dataset. This often involved removing duplicate information between the two data sets and filtering out rows that that did not contain information, as well as parsing the data based on specific criteria. In the latter parts of this process, it involved merging the two data sets from Wikipedia and Kaggle and then combining it with the ratings data.
